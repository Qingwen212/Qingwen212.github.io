[Executives][Bernadette Madarieta]No, I can't really speak to that. I'd say, overall, we've got probably about 25% that we'll need to continue to renegotiate. But again, that's based on pounds and not based on business or dollars.",7,8,9

As we think about that line, it's inclusive of losses across the loan portfolio.

We don't talk about single names, as you would expect. You did see the line -- the other ISG line. You can assume that whatever marks we took on any single name are reflected in that. And I think the way I think about this is we run a portfolio business. We obviously have single credits at any point in time that disappoint relative to others. But it's the total package. And the total package, if you look at it, actually turned out to be very fine given the environment we're in. So on the Plan B, I don't know if the rip we did -- we took about 1,800 heads in early December, would equate to a Plan B. It certainly felt like it. We've reduced -- we took a severance charge, Mike, which affected some of the efficiency ratio for this year, but will improve it for next year. And that was the rightsizing. We were frankly a little overdue. We hadn't done anything for a couple of years. We've had a lot of growth, and we'll continue monitoring that. Obviously, with the way bonus pools work, we've reflected the performance of the firm in the bonus pool. So we're not very different from the rest of the world in that regard. And that obviously resets comp a little bit. So I feel good about where the whole package is. I'm actually, as I said earlier, alluded to, I'm a little more confident about the long -- medium-term outlook for the market. I'm not talking about the first quarter or 2, although Sharon said the first quarter has actually started well. But the medium-term outlook for the markets, I see the Fed has moved from 75 to 50, likely to go to 25. The next stop on the trend line is 0, and then to mention when they will start cutting. Not sure they're going to cut this year, but I think they will be 0 increases this year for sure. So that's the inflection point. And there's a lot of money sitting around waiting to be put to work. And that's our job, is to be the flow of capital between those who have it and those who need it. So I'm pretty confident actually about the outlook. So we're -- we've done our Plan B, I guess. We're not anticipating a Plan C. And we're going to watch and wait for a little while, but I feel pretty good about it.",8,7,8
